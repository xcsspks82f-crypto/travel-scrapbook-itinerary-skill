# Replaceable Image Slot Rules

Load this whenever final scrapbook images are generated, edited, or regenerated. The user's standing improvement request is: scrapbook photo images should be replaceable.

## Product Requirement

Keep the hand-drawn travel scrapbook layout, route clarity, Day badge, handwritten labels, character stickers, weather cards, and reminder cards stable. Make the scenic/food/hotel/transport photos replaceable.

This Skill should output a replacement map for every page, even when the final deliverable is only image prompts.

## Slot Principles

- Treat every photo sticker as a replaceable slot.
- Give each slot a stable ID: `P{page}-IMG{number}`.
- Do not treat character stickers, Day badges, route lines, reminder bubbles, weather cards, or text cards as replaceable photo slots.
- Keep the slot's role and label stable even if the image changes.
- Preserve white border, sticker cutout shape, tilt angle, and approximate position when replacing a photo.
- Replacement must not cover route arrows, train/flight numbers, hotel addresses, ticket prices, weather cards, or hard reminders.
- If exact local/user images are unavailable, use generated or searched representative visuals and mark them as `建议补充图`.

## Slot Manifest Contract

For each page, include a compact `可替换图片槽位` list in the page planning:

| Slot ID | Page Area | Current/Default Visual | Purpose | Replacement Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1-IMG1 | upper route node | arrival station / airport | arrival proof and route node | Replace with user's station/airport photo; keep label and route position. |

Use this manifest to support:

- Whole-page regeneration with the same layout and one or more replaced images.
- Local editing in a design tool.
- API-based image editing with mask/region replacement if available.

## Prompt Addition For Replaceable Photos

Add this sentence to final page prompts:

```text
Design each scenic/food/hotel/transport photo as a distinct replaceable sticker photo slot with clear white border, stable label, and enough spacing so the image can be swapped later without changing the route map or text cards.
```

When a specific replacement is requested:

```text
Keep the same 9:16 scrapbook layout, route order, text cards, Day badge, character stickers, weather cards, and reminder bubbles. Replace only slot [Slot ID] ([slot label]) with [new image description or uploaded image], preserving the same sticker shape, white border, scale, and label position.
```

If multiple replacement slots are requested, process page by page and keep the slot manifest stable.
